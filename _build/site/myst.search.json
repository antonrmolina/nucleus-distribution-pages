Ribosomes coordinate the decoding of mRNA transcripts by tRNA and catalyze the formation of each peptide bond in new proteins, making ribosomes a key component of any protein synthesis system. Ribosomes can be purified from E. coli biomass by a variety of methods (e.g., His-tagged ribosomes can be purified by Ni-His chromatography, as in  Proteins by Ni2+ Gravity Column), but we recommend a two step process: (1) initial, tag-free purification by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and (2) size-selective precipitation by ultracentrifugation. This protocol will show you how to grow E. coli A19 biomass and purify ribosomes by HIC followed by ultracentrifugation.\n\nNote: we purify ribosomes from E. coli A19 biomass\n\nWe purify RNAs and Riboproteins from E. coli A19 biomass (\n\nCGSC 5997), a strain with a mutation in RNase I that improves RNA yields. You can use other RNase deficient strains with this protocol, but you may need to optimize this protocol to achieve high yield and purity.\n\nCaution: work under RNAse-free conditions\n\n‼️All reagents and materials must be prepared RNase-free.
