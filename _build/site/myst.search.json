If you want to report mass concentration of your samples instead, you can approximate as ~40 mg/mL per A260 unit of tRNA.\n\nNEB has a great \n\ntool for converting absorbance units to concentrations.

A clear sign of tRNA degradation are poorly defined, smeared bands. A clean tRNA prep should have distinct bands.\n\nIf your samples appear as a smear on your gel, consider testing your input buffers and final prep for RNase activity (see below).\n\n(Optional) Measure RNase contamination using Ambion RNaseAlert Lab Test Kit.\n\nWe recommend diluting your tRNAs by adding 2 uL to 40 uL of provided sample buffer.","type":"content","url":"/process-1#quality-control","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"make tRNAs","lvl3":"Formulation","lvl2":"Protocol"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/process-1#formulation","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"make tRNAs","lvl3":"Formulation","lvl2":"Protocol"},"content":"Dilute your tRNA stocks in nuclease-free water to your working concentration, depending on your application.
