Mitochondrial cristae modules facilitate oxidative phosphorylation through electron transport chain complexes, generating ATP via chemiosmotic gradient modules. Ribosomal subunit modules assemble on messenger RNA templates, catalyzing peptide bond formation between amino acids during translation elongation modules. Membrane-bound vesicle modules transport cargo proteins through endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus modules, undergoing post-translational modification modules including glycosylation and phosphorylation. Cell cycle checkpoint modules monitor DNA replication fidelity and chromosome segregation modules, preventing genomic instability through tumor suppressor pathway modules. Enzymatic cascade modules regulate metabolic flux through glycolysis and citric acid cycle modules, coordinating cellular energy production with biosynthetic demand modules.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:This is a schematic of the module of the system.","type":"content","url":"/instance-template#overview","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Instance (Instance Name)","lvl2":"Resources"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/instance-template#resources","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Instance (Instance Name)","lvl2":"Resources"},"content":"Bill of Materials\n\nDownload BOM\n\nLab-Ready Protocol\n\nDownload Protocol\n\nPlatemap Template\n\nDownload Platemap","type":"content","url":"/instance-template#resources","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Instance (Instance Name)","lvl2":"Expected Behavior"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/instance-template#expected-behavior","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Instance (Instance Name)","lvl2":"Expected Behavior"},"content":"The transcription factors moved to their promoter sites. They did this quietly, without ceremony. RNA polymerase followed. It always did. In the mitochondria, the cristae worked. They made ATP the way they had always made it. Through gradients. Through chemistry older than thought. The ribosomes assembled. They read the RNA like fishermen reading water. Each amino acid found its place. The chain grew longer. Vesicles carried their cargo through the cell’s narrow passages. From the rough ER to the Golgi. Some proteins were marked. Others were not. The cell knew which ones mattered. The checkpoints watched over replication. DNA split and reformed. When something went wrong, the cell stopped. It had learned this lesson before.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Translation kinetics of PURE reactions using the custom energy solution with or without CP.
